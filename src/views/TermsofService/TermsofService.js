<p><b>TERMS OF SERVICE</b></p>
 
<p><b>Last updated: 05/01/2021</b></p>
 
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
Welcome to The Intro Code (“Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)! As you have just clicked our Terms of Service, please pause, grab a cup of coffee and carefully read the following pages. It will take you approximately 20 minutes.
 
These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our web pages located at soundfiles.fm operated by The Intro Code
 
Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here soundfiles.fm/privacy-policy.
 
Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.
 
If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at support@soundfiles.fm so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.
 
Thank you for being responsible.
 
<p><b>Communications</b></p>
By creating an Account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at.
 
<p><b>Purchases</b></p>
If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.
 
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.
 
We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
 
We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.
 
We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected. 
 
<p><b>Subscriptions</b></p>
Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
 
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or The Intro Code cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting The Intro Code customer support team.
 
A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide The Intro Code with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize The Intro Code to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
 
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, The Intro Code will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
 
<p><b>Free Trial</b></p>
The Intro Code may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).
 
You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.
 
If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by The Intro Code until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
 
At any time and without notice, The Intro Code reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
 
<p><b>Fee Changes</b></p>
The Intro Code, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
 
The Intro Code will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
 
Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
 
<p><b>Refunds</b></p>
Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
 
<p><b>Content</b></p>
Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (“Content”). You are responsible for Content that you post on or through Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.
 
You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through Service. However, by posting Content using Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through Service.
